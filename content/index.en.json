  "introText": "Every year children of all ages (yes, from toddlers to 99-year-olds!), colors, sizes and nations go to sleep on Christmas eve with thrilling anticipation of wonder. Some may have written Santa a letter asking for a new Lego railroad; others have wished secretly for something less tangible, with love and prosperity often topping the list. \n\nWhile some of these wishes may actually need some wizard power to be brought to life, we have one wishlist that we are determined to fulfill this holiday season. We’re no Santas, but for this occasion, each of us can try and become one. Are you with us?\n\nWe’ve gathered some stories of the wonderful people we have treated at our clinics over this year. Behind each of these stories, there are dozens and hundreds more patients enduring similar conditions while raising their harvest, caring for their children, cooking food for their families, laughing, loving and waiting for wonders to happen this Christmas and New Year.\n\nWould you fancy becoming a Secret Santa for one of them? Here are some gifts that they would love for these holidays. After all, their biggest wish is simple: all they want is just to be healthy and live their lives.",

      "body": "“I was only 14 when it happened for the first time. I stopped getting my period, and all of a sudden, my belly started growing bigger and bigger. I was always so sure that you can only get pregnant once you get married… I was so wrong,” our patient Katarina reminisces.\n\nMany women in Guatemala end up giving birth at a very young age. Over the course of their pregnancy, most of them never see a doctor. Their children are born in their homes, with only the local midwives supervising the process. In the local culture, giving birth is viewed as something so natural that it requires no medical interference. However, too often things can turn out more dangerous than expected.\n\nKatarina now has five children. Raising them has been quite a challenge, as all she does for the whole day is look after them and take care of the household. Katarina doesn’t want any more children. Neither do most of the women in the villages nearby who have already given birth a few times before hitting 30.\n\nWe help the women in our community in the safest way we can by offering them contraceptive injections. The effect lasts for a few months.\n\nOne injection costs $2,5. For $25, we can keep 10 women safe from unplanned conceptions.",

      "body": "For as long as she can remember, Abuelita* Maria has been cooking on an open fire. When she was young, hunching over the hot smoke was easier. Now she is 65, but by the way she looks you’d think she could just as well be 80, and her heavy breath adds up to this impression.\n\nOnce Abuelita Maria wandered into our clinic to ask for a pair of shoes for her grandchildren. Someone told her we were giving them out for free, and it was just a lucky coincidence that she decided to see the doctor during her visit. Our volunteers immediately suspected asthma and convinced her to try out an inhaler. Just a few minutes later, Maria was breathing normally for the first time in years. \n\nMore than half of our asthma patients are women. Most families in our village don’t have access to gas stoves, so mothers have to cook on an open fire for years. Most of these women will need inhalers at some point.\n\n With every $65 we get, one more patient of Health & Help will go back home breathing. \n\n*Granny",

      "body": "Doña Elena was so excited to have her first child that she fully immersed herself in her baby from the moment she gave birth. It was not until after a month after the happy date that she realized something was wrong. Not with the baby – God forbid – but with her. \n\nIt all started with seemingly innocent minor headaches, only to grow into severe pains paired with the feeling of weakness, fever, and discomfort in the lower abdomen.\n\nOur doctors diagnosed her with postpartum endometritis – a uterus infection that is sadly common for many new moms. Luckily, the disease was suppressed by antibiotic therapy. But what terrified Elena is that breastfeeding her baby was no longer possible. \n\nThanks to our supply of nutritional baby formula, Elena has been able to feed her child just as well as before. But our storage has its limits, and there are more mothers like Elena in our village: many of them cannot breastfeed because of various female health problems – like lactation mastitis. \n\nOne package of baby formula costs $10. $100 dollars is enough to sustain one healthy baby for almost three months!",

      "body": "“He is burning and panting all the time”, a mother of four children told us as she was showing her little son Martin to our doctors. \n\nEvery rainy night all four children of Amalia end up sleeping in wet hammocks. Their house is made of old plastic walls full of holes and cracks, and when it rains, the water leaks everywhere. Little Martin was no exception, and by the time we saw him, his condition was dreadful. After a thorough examination, the doctors of Health & Help diagnosed the little boy with pneumonia. At least their visit was timely enough to tackle the disease with antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and some pills for reducing fever. \n\nPneumonia is one of the deadliest infectious diseases among children under five. It takes over 800,000 children every year, or around 2,200 every day. In Nicaragua, where Martin lives, pneumonia is one of the major causes of death for infants and toddlers. Most deaths from infectious diseases are preventable through early diagnosis and treatment. \n\nThe price of treatment for one child with pneumonia costs only $12.  But not everyone in the village can afford it. For $120, we can be sure that at least 10 children can be safe over the cold season.",

He has become our regular visitor – always accompanied by his children, always cheerful and determined to get better. \n\nDon Sergio is 74, so a bunch of inevitable health issues followed years of hard work at the farm. But what upsets him most is his diabetic foot, which does not even allow our patient to get to our clinic by himself: every time he has to pay $15 for a car to deliver him. For four months, he had to take that ride weekly, as his condition developed into an open wound: diabetes can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage in the feet, along with loss of feeling. A patient may not notice an injury on their feet, which can be vulnerable to infections. \n\nAlmost 1 in five of our patients have diabetes, and the medications we provide for them are amongst some of the most expensive treatments we offer. A large portion of our donations is spent on purchasing these supplies.\n\nWe cannot cure diabetes, but we can give our patients a chance to live longer, healthier lives. Each month it costs us $257 for each patient.",
